##Data Wrangling in dplyr

Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Load data
```{r}
gapminder <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/gapminder.csv")
```

Explore data
```{r}
head(gapminder)
tail(gapminder)
str(gapminder)

#column names
names(gapminder)
ncol(gapminder)
```

Learning the filter function
```{r}
filter(gapminder, lifeExp <35) #filtering for the condition that life expectancy is over a certain age

#just look at one country

filter(gapminder, country == "Mexico") #use the double equals

#two variables - year and country

filter(gapminder, country == "Mexico", year ==2002) #add a comma then next condition

#What is the average life expectency in Brazil between 1987 and 2007?
y <- filter(gapminder, country == "Brazil", year > 1987) #2007 is the max so this works
mean(y$lifeExp)

#two variables but in between two values- just add two conditions
y <- filter(gapminder, country == "Brazil", year > 1987, year < 2007) #to do inbetween
mean(y$lifeExp) #could also put in an & symbol instead of the commas

y <- filter(gapminder, country == "Brazil", year > 1987 & year < 2007) #to do inbetween
mean(y$lifeExp) #could also put in an & symbol instead of the commas
